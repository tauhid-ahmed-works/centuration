Some of our CT-CUBE  models are optimally designed for a safe examination under such  conditions: The control room and the patient room are equipped with two  separate entrances so that contact between patient and medical staff can be minimized or avoided entirely. In addition, separate air  conditioning prevents viruses or bacteria from spreading from one room  to the other. Another plus in case of an emergency: With the CT-CUBE  examinations take place outside the clinic or practice building, which  is reducing the risk of infection for patients and visitors inside.",
